# Set-Up-Personal-IP-Network
The goal of this project is to set up a small IP network consisting of hosts and a router. The network will function with full end-to-end connectivity, and it can be experimented with tools like ping and traceroute.  Consider the following network topology:  h1      h2   \   /     R1   /   \ h3      h4  Here, R is an IP router and h1..h4 are endpoints. In a safe experimental setting running inside a virtual machine, use the `ip` suite of commands to set up the right IP addresses for all the interfaces, and the right routing table entries for all the routers and endpoints in this network.
